    "lyrics":"Bleak\nOpeth\nBeating\nHeart still beating for the cause\nFeeding\nSoul still feeding on the loss\nAching\nLimbs are aching from the rush\nFading\nYou are fading from my sight\nBreak of morning, coldness lingers on\nShroud me into nightmares of the sun\nMoving\nI am moving closer to your side\nLuring\nYou are luring me into the night\nCrying\nWho is crying for you here\nDying\nI am dying fast inside your tears\nPlunging towards bereavement faster yet\nClearing thoughts, my mind is set\nDevious movements in your eyes\nMoved me from relief\nBreath comes out white clouds with your lies\nAnd filters through me\nYou're close to the final word\nYou're staring right past me in dismay\nA liquid seeps from your chest\nAnd drains me away\nMist ripples round your thin white neck\nAnd…\nHelp me cure you\nAtone for all you've done\nHelp me leave you\nAs all the days are done\nNight falls again\nTaking what's left of me\nSlight twist, shivering corpse\nOrnated with water, fills the cracks\nClasped in my limbs by tradition\nThis is all you need\nSongwriters: Mikael Lars Akerfeldt\nBleak lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group",
